<h1><a href="./">The CPAN &ldquo;Once a Week, Every Week&rdquo; Contest</a></h1>

<p>While the idea of this contest wasn&rsquo;t proposed until 2012,
it&rsquo;s interesting to go back to the start of the CPAN and see who
made long release chains even when they weren&rsquo;t trying to.</p>

<h2>The 200 Longest Chains of All Time</h2>
<p class="tblNote">Starting from August 16, 1995</p>
